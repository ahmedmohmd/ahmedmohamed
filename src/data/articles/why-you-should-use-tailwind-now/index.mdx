## Why Should You use Tailwind instead of Bootstrap?

### <span class="text-2xl text-white font-semibold">1. Write Less, Do More</span>

One of the Measure problems that I was Facing when I am using Bootstrap was that I should write more and more CSS code to overite Bootstrap Properties and this is a causes performance problems in your website but with tailwind It's different, Now in some projects, I do not use any external CSS code.

### <span class="text-2xl text-white font-semibold">2. More Performance</span>

Tailwind uses the <A href="https://purgecss.com/">PurgeCSS</A> tool to remove unused CSS code and if you do not know that is a fantastic feature because performance is the most thing that you should care about in your website, On the other hand, bootstrap does not have this feature.

### <span class="text-2xl text-white font-semibold">3. Support the Dark and Light theme</span>

Another amazing Feature of tailwind that I loved so much is that tailwind supports dark and light theme features in the easiest way and with <A href="https://flowbite.com/">Flowbite</A> library, It just got easier and easier.

### <span class="text-2xl text-white font-semibold">4. pseudo-classes handling</span>

In tailwind, you can set and handle pseudo-classes like <B>hover</B>, <B>active</B>, <B>placeholder</B> ...etc

### <span class="text-2xl text-white font-semibold">5. Easy to be configurable and customizable</span>

As you know the framework only will not satisfy all your needs, you may need some extra colors, fonts, standard sizes, and more so you need to implement these things by yourself in external style sheets but with a tailwind, you can implement it by easy way, you can add your preferable colors, fonts, colors and animations just in a few seconds.

## Conclusion

Tailwind is not just a normal CSS framework that has some predefined classes, It uses technologies and tools that make your development process as can easier so you should try it at least once in your projects.
