## Why We Forget?

First let's know how our Memory works.
Human Memory constructed from two main Parts:

<Ul
  items={[
    "Short-Term Memory: Everything that you learned the first time is included in this type of memory and you can store 4 chunks at maximum.",
    "Long-Term Memory: This Type is like the Big store, Anything that you learn for a long, Your Brain considers it as an important thing so it stores it in this type of Memory.",
  ]}

  iconsColor="bg-orange-500"
/>

Our Brain is smart enagh to know what is the important information and what is the unimportant information.
So our Mission now is to Move the Information from Short-Term Memory to Long-Term Memory but How can we do this ðŸ¤”?
Thte Answer is easy: By say to our brain: "Hi My Brain, this is an important information and it should be in the long-term memory, So can you do this mession for me :)"
But How can we do this ðŸ¤”?
This is what we will cover it in the next sectoion.

## How to solve this Problem

The Solution is Very Simple, It's **Repetition** and **Practcing**.
Are you wondered why I don't forget my name?, or Why we don't forget my friends Name?, This Because Repitition.
Our brain does not forget two kinds of information:

<Ul
  items={[
    "The Repeated Informations",
    "Information related to emotions such as sadness and joy, and this explains why we do not forget the people we lose",
  ]}
  textColor="text-white"
  iconsColor="bg-orange-500"
/>

Repetition is what we need from them, So to solve this problem we should Repeat this information more and more.
So now you will tell me ok Ahmed I know the Solution now All thing that I should Do now repeats it 100 times or higher and I will remember it easily, And this is wrong because there is another thing in the Repetition Technique.
This technique is called **Spaced Repetition**, It means that you should repeat the information but at spaced times like every two days or every 3 days ..etc
So now let's get an example.
Now I am learning a new Topic like Big O notation in algorithms So I will follow the following Steps:

The Second and Most Important Thing is **Practicing**, Practicing is important because without it you can't exercise your learned knowledge.

<Ul
  items={[
    "I will learn this topic and Understand it very will",
    "I will Practice this topic to test my knowladge",
    "I will review It in the next day",
    "I will review It again but in the next 3 days",
    "I will review It again but in the next week",
    "...etc",
  ]}
  textColor="text-white"
  iconsColor="bg-orange-500"
/>

I feel that you tell you self: "If I learned a lot of topics, How can I remember to review all those topics?ðŸ˜£, Is there an solution fot this problem?ðŸ˜°"

Unfortenately Yes there is an Technique That will help you very will, This techneque is called **Flash Cards**.
This Techneeque is like This:

<Ul
  items={[
    "Get a small and empty flash cards",
    "Devide these flashcard two three sections: easy, medium, hard",
    "And Every New Topic that you learn put it as question on front face of the flash card and the answer on the back face, and put it in New sections",
    "When you review this topic in the next day and you feel that you remember it easy, Put it in Medium section.",
    "In the next week when you review it, test your self again and if you found that you can remember in easily put it in the Easy section",
    "Repeat this process and if you found that there is an hard topic move it in the suitable section",
  ]}
