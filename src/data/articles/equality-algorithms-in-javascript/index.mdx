## Introduction

In this article, we will know what is Equality Algorithms and How we can use them in JavaScript.
So let's get started... ðŸ‘‰

---

## What are Equality Algorithms

Equality Algorithms are the Techniques that JavaScript uses to check if the First value equals the Second Value.

So now we know what Equality Algorithms know let us know how to use them.

There are four algorithms to check equality in JavaScript:

<Ul
  items={[
    "Loosley Equality Algorithm ( == )",
    "Strict Equality Algorithm ( === )",
    "Same Value Equality Algorithm ( Object.is() )",
    "Same Value Zero",
  ]}
/>

## Loosely Equality Algorithm ( == )

```javascript
console.log("1" == 1); // true
console.log(false == 0); // true
```

Look at the above code, We can see that the result is true although the data types of each one are different so what is going on here?

The secret in the <B> == </B> operator, when you check the equality of two different types in JavaScript
this operator automatically converts one of the two values and then compares them and this is what call Implicit <A href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Type_coercion" >Type Coercion</A>.

So the <B> == </B> equality operator makes Type Coercion in we use it and Because of this,
we called it <B>Loosely Equality Operator</B>.

## Strict Equality Algorithm ( === )

This Equality Parameter behaves like the previous one, The Only Difference is that
it doesn't make any type of conversion in the values so it gives you the exact thing
that you want and because of this, you should use this Equality Parameter instead of Loosly Equality Parameter.
So if we repeat the previous example with === Parameter this will be the result:

```javascript
console.log("1" === 1); // false
console.log(false === 0); // false

console.log(1 === 1); // true
console.log(false === false); // true
```

## Strict Equality Algorithm ( === )

Same Value Equality Algorithm
In JavaScript that let you check if the First Value is the same Other Value.

But Waitâ€¦Is not <B> === </B> Operator do the same thing

Are You Sure?? Let us see the following example first:

```javascript
console.log(NaN === NaN); // false
```

What Happened here is that <B>NaN</B> cannot be compared to another <B>NaN</B> in
JavaScript so <B>Object.is()</B> Solved this Problem.

It checks if the First value if it has the same value as the Second value.

So if We Repeated the previous example with <B>Object.is()</B> we will get the desirable Results

```javascript
console.log(NaN === NaN); // true
```

But keep in your mind these exceptions for using It :

```javascript
Object.is(-0, +0); // false
console.log(-0 === +0); //true

// ---

Object.is(NaN, NaN); // true
console.log(NaN === NaN); // false

// ---

const obj1 = { name: "Ahmed", age: 22 };
const obj2 = { name: "Ahmed", age: 22 };

console.log(Object.is(obj1, obj2)); // false
console.log(obj1 === obj2); // false

/* 
      In this example two methods gave the same result but there are different
      in there tichneeques:

      [1] === when compare Objects checks if the two Objects refer to the same Reference
      [2] Object.is() when compare Objects checks if the two Objects have the same values
*/
```

Strict Equality Operator is widely used but there are situations that
the <B>Object.is()</B> method can help you will like checking if the coming number is
positive or Negative Zero and so On.

## Same Value Zero Equality Algorithm

Algorithmâ€™s Name explains itself, this algorithm is identical to the previous one
except that <B>+0</B> and <B> -0</B> or **NaN **values are considered the same, So let us implement it:

```javascript
function sameValueZero(x, y) {
  if (typeof x === "number" && typeof y === "number") {
    // x and y are equal (may be -0 and 0) or they are both NaN
    return x === y || (x !== x && y !== y);
  }
  return x === y;
}
```

---

## Conclusion

To summarise the article. You shouldnâ€™t use <B>loosely equality</B> instead of it you can use <B>strict equality</B>.

You can use the same value or same zero value algorithms in case you need to do
specific tasks like checking if the accepted value is <B>+0</B> or <B> -0 </B> â€¦etc

I hope you enjoyed this article and benefited even by 1 percent finally see you in the next articleâ€¦ðŸ‘‹
